# Face_Recognition : 

- Face_Recognition project with Python and C

- This is the Face_Recognition project for the begineer, if you just start an project in this field, Welcome to join me and explored the interested here together.
 

## 1.What is & Why Face-Recognition ?

- Face-Recognition is the technology for extract the individual-face-information, transforming into the high dimension vector.
And then, you can divide different people's face with those individual high-dimension vector,  

- Here some example showing how does it work :

 ![image](data/image/consine similarity.png)

	
	
	
- Show image about the face dievided from 1.high dimension 2.AM-Softmax function


## 2.Use Face-Recognition in real world ?

- Here is the example of my own image compare with others people, and you'll discover some important index, like : 

### A.The Cosine-Similarity / Euclidian Similarity : 

- Use Cosine-Similarity / Euclidian-Similarity to Digitizing the distance between two different face.

### B.Threshold - Setting : 

- Setting threshold For divide deifferent face.  
- Predict those two-people face the same or not by threshold.

- Visualize the thersholde swtting value in the code and the result judge output

## 3.Other Interested Application 5, 68 landmarks : 

### The application of 5 & 68 landmarks for grab the location to the face

- Show the output of 5-Landmarks
![image](data.png)

- Show the output of 68-Landmarks :
